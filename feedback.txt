Natalia Zhdanova: Glassdoor data scraper
Really good idea, so useful!
I loved that you are using modules like bs4 and pandas, those are clever options to web scraping.
Your code is clear and easy to follow because you structured it well and commented all the steps.
I just wish you could use more of the concepts we've learned in class, like Databases (instead of creating a excel file you could save
the info in a database ;) )
